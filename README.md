axn.js
======

AXN (pronounced "action". Yeah... it's a stretch...) is just
a quick project that has DOM elements store events & data models
which are then parsed by the 'axn' object.

Caveats
-------
The usual mumbo-jumbo: "This is still in progress, not fully tested, blah blah blah".


Usage
-----

I'll update this properly later - but for now, take a look at index.html and sample.js
to get a feel for things
